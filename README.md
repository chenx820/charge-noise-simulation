## Technical Details

### Noise Components

1. **White Noise**: Gaussian distributed random noise with flat spectrum
2. **1/f Noise**: Generated by filtering white noise, power spectral density inversely proportional to frequency
3. **Random Walk Noise**: Cumulative white noise, dominant at low frequencies
4. **Periodic Noise**: Simulates external interference signals

### 1/f Noise Detection

1/f noise is detected through the following steps:

1. Calculate Fourier transform of the signal
2. Calculate power spectral density
3. Perform log-log fitting in low frequency regions
4. Compare fitting slope with theoretical value of -1.0

### Parameter Settings

- Number of samples: 20000
- Sampling interval: 0.05 milliseconds
